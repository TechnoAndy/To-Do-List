# To-do-list
- In this project, I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. You can add your daily to do list and cross them off your list as you have completed it. The data gets stored to local storage but is removed once the task has been deleted off this lis. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.
